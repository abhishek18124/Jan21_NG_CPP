/*

Given a string we need to return count of "all odd and even substrings which on compressing 
become palindrome"
   
The string should be compressed such that consecutive duplicates of characters are replaced 
with a single character. For "aaabbaa", the compressed string will be "aba". 
  
Note : The string will contain only characters 'a' and 'b'
