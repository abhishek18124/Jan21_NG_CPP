/*

The stock span problem is a financial problem where we have a series of N daily price quotes for a stock 
and we need to calculate span of stockâ€™s price for all N days. You are given an array of length N, where 
ith element of array denotes the price of a stock on ith. Find the span of stock's price on ith day, for 
every 1<=i<=N. A span of a stock's price on a given day, i, is the maximum number of consecutive days 
before the (i+1)th day, for which stock's price on these days is less than or equal to that on the ith day.

Example 1:

Input : 30 35 40 38 35
Output: 1  2  3  1  1  END

Example 2:

Input : 8 7 4 3 6 9 1
Output: 1 1 1 1 3 6 1 END
